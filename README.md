## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology

- **Frontend/Backend:** Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Mobile-responsive design)
- **Icons & UI:** Lucide React & Radix UI
- **AI Engine:** Integrated via **Lovable AI** & OpenAI for natural language processing.

### Why I used this approach?
Given the **12-hour timeframe**, I chose to leverage **Lovable.dev** as an AI-orchestration tool. This allowed me to:
1. Build a high-fidelity, bug-free UI rapidly.
2. Focus on the **logic of medical context** rather than boilerplate setup.
3. Ensure a fully deployed and functional MVP within the strict deadline.
